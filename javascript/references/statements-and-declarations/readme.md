## Statements and declarations by category

### Control flow

**Block**

A block statement is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets.

**break**

Terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

**continue**

Terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

**Empty**

An empty statement is used to provide no statement, although the JavaScript syntax would expect one.

**if...else**

Executes a statement if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement can be executed.

**switch**

Evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

**throw**

Throws a user-defined exception.

**try...catch**

Marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response, should an exception be thrown.

### Declarations

**var**

Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

**let**

Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

**const**

Declares a read-only named constant.

### Functions and classes

**function**

Declares a function with the specified parameters.

**function\***

Generator Functions enable writing iterators more easily.

**async function**

Declares an async function with the specified parameters.

**return**

Specifies the value to be returned by a function.

**class**

Declares a class.

### Iterations

**do...while**

Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.

**for**

Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop.

**for each...in**

Iterates a specified variable over all values of object's properties. For each distinct property, a specified statement is executed.

**for...in**

Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.

**for...of**

Iterates over iterable objects (including arrays, array-like objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

**for await...of**

Iterates over async iterable objects, array-like objects, iterators and generators, invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

**while**

Creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

### Others

**debugger**

Invokes any available debugging functionality. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.

**export**

Used to export functions to make them available for imports in external modules, and other scripts.

**import**

Used to import functions exported from an external module, another script.

**import.meta**

An object exposing context-specific metadata to a JavaScript module.

**label**

Provides a statement with an identifier that you can refer to using a break or continue statement.

**with**

Extends the scope chain for a statement.
